[comment]: <> (## Our Goal)

[comment]: <> (The objective of this tutorial is to look at how we can customise Flutter Widgets to achieve our own beautiful user interface designs. If you have a designer on board, no matter how unconventional their designs are, we can create them using Flutter. )


[comment]: <> (## What you will create)

[comment]: <> (Weâ€™re going to make a Body Mass Index Calculator inspired by the beautiful designs made by [Ruben Vaalt]&#40;https://dribbble.com/shots/4585382-Simple-BMI-Calculator&#41;. It will be a multi screen app with simple functionality but full-on custom styling. )
